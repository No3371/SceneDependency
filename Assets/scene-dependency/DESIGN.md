- Must works in following situations:
  - Editor playmode
  - Builds
- To correctly load dependency before a subject scene is loaded, the dependencies must be saved separately from scenes.
  - (We can not access gameobjects until a scene is loaded and activated)
- To save the dependencies
  - Save it as ScriptableObject so it's easy to be persist (by reference it in scene monobehavior)
  - Use addressables to make sure it's packed into builds (also easy access at runtime)
